/**
 * Class defining the API to an L-system. 
 * 
 * <p><strong>Setting up the L-system. </strong>
 * The implementation builds its data structures 
 * by calling {@link #addRule(Symbol, String)}, 
 * {@link #setAxiom(String)} and {@link #setAction(char, String)}. 
 * The method {@link #initFromJSON(String, Turtle)} parses an input file.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Using the L-system. </strong>
 * The implementation provides access to symbols as instances of {@link Symbol}, and 
 * to sequences as <code>Iterable&lt;Symbol&gt;</code>. 
 * (Note that implementing classes do not 
 * need to store an actual backing list or array for the iterator, 
 * but could calculate 
 * {@link java.util.Iterator#next() } 
 * on the fly.) As a consequence, they can be read only once. 
 * 
 * <p><strong>Random rules.</strong>Implementing classes will need to 
 * generate pseudorandom numbers in a repeatable manner. 
 * The {@link #resetRnd()} methods is provided to 
 * produce the same random rule choices 
 * in {@link #tell(Turtle, Iterator, int)}.
 * The methods {@link #rndInt(int)} and {@link #rndElement(List)} 
 * produce uniformly distributed random values.
